## 🧱 Defensive Core — Updated Chemistry Map

| Pair | LHD | RHD | OVR | Chem | Notes |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 1 | **M. Rielly (88)** | **C. Tanev (84)** | +1 | ✅ Hold Line/Pinch, Cycle/Shoot Bias both active |
| 2 | **J. McCabe (85)** | **B. Carlo (86)** | +1 | ✅ Defensive reliability + PK1 mainstay |
| 3 | **O. Ekman-Larsson (84)** | **M. Dumba (82)** | 0 | ⚙️ New pairing — offensive shot threat, PP2 candidate |

**Strategy Note:**  
- D1: Possession-focused exits via Rielly; Tanev stays conservative.  
- D2: Heavy shutdown — deploy vs rush-heavy opponents (NJD, BUF, OTT).  
- D3: Transition utility; Dumba’s RH shot stabilizes PP2 and secondary puck retrievals.

## 🧮 Cap & Contract Snapshot
| Metric | Before Trades | After Trades |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Cap Hit** | ~$87.855M | ~$87.905M |
| **Cap Space** | $145K | $95K |
| **SPC Count** | 50 | 49 |
| **Avg Age (D core)** | 29.3 | 29.6 |

**Comment:** Cap impact minimal; net +1 skilled asset (Mercer) while staying under the buffer.  
Dumba’s $3.9M fits short term; Järnkrok’s $2.1M outgoing offsets balance.

## 🚀 Forward Impacts
**Incoming:** RW Dawson Mercer (Top-6, RH shot, 2-way)**  
- Integrates on L3 RW beside Järnkrok/Knies (chem +1 projected).  
- Adds secondary scoring: RH one-timer, energy, defensive reliability.  
- Future PP2 rotation (flank option).  

**Outgoing:** Calle Järnkrok, Bobby McMann, Pontus Holmberg, Scott Laughton → clears bottom-six redundancy.

## 📦 Draft Capital Delta (Post-Wave)
| Year | Additions | Subtractions | Net |
|------|------------|---------------|------|
| 2025 | 2nd (SEA), 3rd (LAK) | 2nd (CAR), 5th (TOR) | +0 picks, improved quality |
| 2026 | 2nd (BOS) | — | +1 asset |

🧾 **Result:** Net positive value (+1 impact player, +1 2nd, +1 3rd).  Canon metrics remain intact.

## 🧠 Canon Commentary
> *“Mercer’s arrival shifts our middle-six chemistry upward without jeopardizing long-term cap control. Dumba fortifies the right side depth that previously relied too heavily on Liljegren’s progression. Combined, they form a stabilized yet mobile defense core, aligning with Canon’s Win-Now + Develop-Future hybrid mandate.”*
